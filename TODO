Logic Pro : looks like Logic Pro X now supports volume automation : https://support.apple.com/kb/PH13242?locale=fr_FR&viewlocale=en_US

ProTools first AAF Support through DigiTranslator 2.0 : PT 6.1 - 2003
ProTools first AAF integrated support : PT 9.0 - 2011

TODO :
======
    X Better error handling : no exit, return value
    * Better error handling : error codes, print functions etc..

    * Mob::AppCode : see AAF_EditProtocol 6.5
    * CompositionMob's UsageCode

    * Support for Legacy Transitions (Does someone care..?)
    * Event Markers

***** Ignore Rendered Audio Effects
      This setting will bypass all the audio effects that were created in the Avid editing
      environment. This will give you the raw, unaffected audio to work with.
      MasterMob Segment AAFClassID_EssenceGroup ??

***** Where the fuck is the ProTools Comment ??? looks like it does not exist !!
      Ensure it exists.



    * CONFIG : Replace 2 values VaryingValue with fixed value
    * CONFIG : Fallback fade/x-fade curve types
    * CONFIG : Force essence length retrieval
    * CONFIG : PostProcessing on/off
               -> Replace rendered fade clips by real fades or x-fades
               -> Remove any "Sample Accurate Edits"
               -> Convert whole envelope under -90dB to Mute

    * What the hell is happening with ADP-NOOPTION essences ??
      -> AIFC descriptor / external .mp4 essences.


    * Add type to aafPropertyDef struct.
      -> this way we can find out :
            AAFClassID_Mob::MobAttributeList (0xfffd)
            AAFClassID_Component::ComponentAttributeList (0xffff)
