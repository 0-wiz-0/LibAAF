	* AAF with per track Gain
	* AAF with per track PAN
	* AAF with per track Gain + PAN

	* AAF with per track variable Gain
	* AAF with per track variable PAN

	* AAF with stereo track and gain applied (SteroAudioGain ?) + xfade (stereoAudioDissolve ?)
	* AAF with TwoParametersAudioDissolve

	* AAF with per-clip fx (eq, comp) -> how is it represented ?
	* Mixdown ?


	* Small composition, one clip ( ~3*512kB ), no EditProtocol.
