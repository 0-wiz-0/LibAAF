NOTES:
======

ProTools does not export clip fades data, it render fades as audio clips.
ProTools does export track volume automation as clip-based.
ProTools does not export track's PAN ?
ProTools exports stereo tracks as separated tracks for each channel.

 -> Fades are always named "Fade 1", "Fade 2", etc. cant we find and rebuild fades after those clips ?
 -> Stereo tracks file names are named "some_file_name.L", "some_file_name.R".

TODO :
======

	* libwave
	* libaifc

TEST :
======

	* AAF with stereo track and gain applied (SteroAudioGain ?) + xfade (stereoAudioDissolve ?)
	* AAF with TwoParametersAudioDissolve

	* AAF with per-clip fx (eq, comp) -> how is it represented ?
	* Mixdown ?


	* Small composition, one clip ( ~3*512kB ), no EditProtocol.
	  -> multiple EssenceData nodes ?
